    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p class="text_column">In 2021 I had just graduated high school and with my newly gained free time, my parents suggested I use it and go to the Nebraska Nail Technology School.Not only did I recieve my diploma in May while still in Nail Tech, I also graduated Nail Tech just a few weeks after.</p>
    <p class="text_column">It was never my full intention to pursue Nail Tech as my career. I proceeded to go to college for Vet Tech and then changed my mind a few times and landed on Graphic Design. While still in Graphic Design, I decided the job I was working wasn't meant for me. I needed something more personal.</p>
    <p class="text_column">Trying to find a different job that was more creative was hard. Everything required a degree of some sort or years of experience to even consider you. I was frustrated and took a step back. I realized I never gave the beauty industry a true chance and made the leap. </p>

      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <img src="images/knit sock.jpeg" alt="" width="400" height="200" class="cards"/>
      <p>My hobbies include anything and everything that allows me to be myself and be creative. I love taking some materials and making something beautiful out of them. I focus mostly on fiber arts: knitting, crocheting, and cross stitch. I also love anything outdoors. Longbording is one of my favorite hobbies that gets me out of my head.</p>

      <h3>Mission</h3>
      <img src="images/Kainin and I standing.png" alt="" width="400" height="200" class="cards"/>
      <p>My goal in life is to spread love and art. I think there is beauty everywhere we go and to dwell on the bad things in life is just not worth it. It's easier said than done but I'd rather be the person to make someones day a little better than be the person to make it worse. A little smile goes a long way, and a small gesture goes miles.</p>
